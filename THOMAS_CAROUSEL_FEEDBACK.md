# Thomas's Visual Feedback (Feb 16, 10:52 PM)

These are CONFIRMED visual issues Thomas is seeing on the live site:

1. **Colored borders don't go around cards** — the ring/border is not visible or not wrapping the entire card
2. **Some cards cut off information inside them** — text/content is being clipped, cards may be too narrow or overflow-hidden is cutting content
3. **Uneven spacing between the 3 carousel sections** — gaps between Featured/Popular/New are not equal
4. **"Browse OpenClaw Upgrades" text is directly on top of Featured carousel** — the 20px gap isn't working or isn't enough
5. **Popular carousel title has no emoji but Featured (⭐) and New (🆕) do** — inconsistent heading style

ALL of these must be fixed.
