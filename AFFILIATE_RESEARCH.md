## 1. Why People Promote (Psychology Breakdown)

### Primary Motivators (ranked by strength)

**1. Money — but it's more nuanced than "give them cash"**
People don't just want commission — they want *predictable, growing income*. The difference between a 7.5% commission and a tiered structure that goes to 15% is massive psychologically. The tier system makes people feel like they're building something, not just doing one-off referrals.

**2. Identity & Status**
People promote things that make them look smart, connected, or ahead of the curve. AI agent templates are a *perfect* category for this — recommending them signals technical sophistication. Give affiliates a visible badge ("Molt Mart Partner") and they become walking endorsements because it enhances their personal brand.

**3. Ease / Low Friction**
The #1 killer of affiliate activity is friction. If sharing requires more than 2 clicks, most affiliates won't do it. Pre-written tweets, one-click copy links, and ready-made content are not nice-to-haves — they're essential.

**4. Social Proof & Momentum**
People promote harder when they see others succeeding. A leaderboard showing "Top affiliate earned $2,400 this month" creates aspiration. Even showing "47 affiliates earned their first commission this week" normalizes the behavior.

**5. Reciprocity**
Give affiliates something *first* — free premium templates, early access to new listings, exclusive content. This triggers the reciprocity instinct: they received value, now they want to give back by promoting.

**6. Sunk Cost / Commitment Escalation**
Once someone shares their first link, they're invested. The key is getting them to that first share within 5 minutes of signing up. After that, consistency bias kicks in — they see themselves as "someone who promotes Molt Mart."

### Psychological Principles Applied to Molt Mart

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | "You sent 340 visitors to AI tool sites last month. At 7.5% commission, that's ~$X you didn't earn." |
| **Anchoring** | Show the Platinum tier earnings first: "Top affiliates earn 15% on every sale." Then reveal Bronze starts at 7.5%. |
| **Social Proof** | "Join 500+ affiliates" (even if aspirational early on, use "Join our growing affiliate community") |
| **Reciprocity** | Free premium template upon affiliate signup |
| **Variable Rewards** | Random "2x commission day" surprises, bonus for hitting milestones |
| **Commitment/Consistency** | Onboarding flow: share first link → see first click → get hooked |
| **Endowed Progress** | Show progress bar starting at 20% filled ("You're already 20% to your first payout!") |
| **Scarcity** | "First 100 affiliates get lifetime 10% base commission" |

## 2. Commission Structure Recommendation

### Tiered Model (Recommended)

| Tier | Referral Sales | Commission | Rationale |
|------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Bronze** | 0–10 | 7.5% | Low enough to be sustainable, high enough to be interesting |
| **Silver** | 11–50 | 10% | Reward for proven effort; this is where most active affiliates land |
| **Gold** | 51–100 | 12.5% | Semi-serious promoters; worth the extra margin |
| **Platinum** | 100+ | 15% | Power affiliates; they drive volume that justifies the rate |

### Key Commission Decisions

- **Lifetime attribution:** Once a user is referred, the affiliate earns on ALL their future purchases — not just the first. This is the single most important feature for retention. It transforms affiliates from "one-time referrers" into "relationship builders."
- **Cookie duration:** 30 days (already planned). This is industry standard. Consider 90 days for Platinum affiliates as a perk.
- **Two-tier referrals (future):** Earn 2% when someone you recruited as an affiliate makes a sale. This turns affiliates into recruiters. Implement in v2.
- **Minimum payout:** $25. Low enough that new affiliates can reach it quickly (2-3 template sales), high enough to batch payments efficiently.
- **Payout frequency:** Monthly, net-30 (30-day hold for refund window).

### Why This Structure Works

- Bronze at 7.5% is already generous for digital products (industry average is 5-10%)
- The jump from 7.5% → 10% at Silver is the most motivating gap — it's achievable and feels like a real upgrade
- Platinum at 15% is a strong ceiling that motivates without destroying margins (digital products have ~90% margins)
- Tier progress is based on *total referral sales* not monthly — affiliates never lose progress

## 3. Feature List (Ranked by Impact on Activation)

### Tier 1: Must-Have (Day 1)

1. **One-click referral link copy** — Absolute baseline. Copy button + auto-generated link.
2. **Real-time click tracking** — Affiliates need to see that their link *works*. Seeing the first click is the dopamine hit that drives continued sharing.
3. **Earnings dashboard** — Simple: total earned, pending, paid. No affiliate will promote blind.
4. **Pre-written social posts** — 3-5 ready-to-tweet/post messages with the referral link auto-inserted. Reduces friction to zero.
5. **Referral cookie middleware** — 30-day attribution. Already planned.

### Tier 2: High Impact (Week 2-3)

6. **Earnings calculator on landing page** — Interactive: "If you refer X people → earn $Y/month." This is the #1 conversion tool for the affiliate signup page.
7. **One-click social sharing buttons** — Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Discord share with pre-filled text.
8. **Affiliate tier badges** — Visible on profile. Status motivator.
9. **Progress bar to next tier** — Shows "14/50 referrals to Silver" with visual bar. Endowed progress effect.
10. **Email notifications** — "You earned a new commission!" — Pavlovian conditioning.

### Tier 3: Growth Multipliers (Month 2+)

11. **Leaderboard** — Top 10 affiliates by earnings this month. Public or opt-in.
12. **Pre-made banner/graphics** — For blog posts, YouTube descriptions, email newsletters.
13. **Affiliate-specific landing pages** — Custom URLs like `moltmart.com/ref/username`.
14. **Monthly contests** — "Top referrer this month wins $500 bonus." Variable reward schedule.
15. **Two-tier referral system** — Recruit affiliates, earn on their sales.

## 4. Landing Page Persuasion Elements

**Order matters.** This sequence is based on attention economics and conversion psychology:

- Slider: "Average template price" ($15/$25/$50)
- **Output:** "You could earn **$187.50/month** at Bronze, or **$375/month** at Platinum"

## 6. Activation Strategy

> Getting affiliates from "signed up" to "actively promoting"

### The First 5 Minutes (Critical Window)

1. **Instant onboarding:** After clicking "Become an Affiliate," immediately show their referral link. No forms, no waiting.
2. **First share prompt:** "Share your link now to start tracking clicks" with one-click Twitter/LinkedIn buttons and pre-written text.
3. **Endowed progress:** Show progress bar at 20%: "✅ Account created. Next: Share your first link."
4. **Free template:** "Here's a free premium template as a thank-you for joining." (Reciprocity trigger — now they feel obligated to reciprocate.)

### Week 1: Build the Habit

5. **First click email:** "🎉 Someone clicked your link!" — sent immediately when first click is tracked. This is the hook.
6. **Daily/weekly click digest:** "Your link got 12 clicks this week" — keeps them aware even before conversions.
7. **First commission celebration:** "💰 You earned your first commission! $3.75" — with social share prompt ("Share your win").
8. **Suggested sharing targets:** "AI communities on Reddit, Twitter AI threads, your newsletter" — reduce decision paralysis.

### Month 1: Cement the Identity

9. **Milestone emails:** "You've referred 5 users! 5 more to reach Silver tier."
10. **Monthly earnings summary:** Even if $0, show activity stats to maintain connection.
11. **Content ideas email:** "5 ways to promote Molt Mart that actually work" — educational content.
12. **Badge unlock:** After first sale, unlock "Molt Mart Partner" badge on their profile.

## 7. Retention Strategy

> Keeping affiliates engaged for months/years

### Ongoing Engagement Loops

1. **Lifetime commissions** — The most powerful retention tool. Every referred user that buys again = passive income for the affiliate. This alone keeps people engaged because their earnings grow without additional effort.

2. **Tier progression** — Permanent tiers mean affiliates never feel like they're "starting over." Even inactive affiliates retain their tier and can pick up where they left off.

3. **New template alerts** — "New hot template just listed! Share it with your audience." Give affiliates first access to trending products with pre-written promotional content.

4. **Monthly leaderboard** — Reset monthly so new affiliates can compete. Show top 10 with earnings (anonymized or opt-in names). Prize for #1 each month.

5. **Seasonal campaigns** — "Black Friday: 2x commissions for 48 hours!" Create urgency spikes 3-4x per year.

6. **Affiliate newsletter** — Bi-weekly: top performing templates, sharing tips, success stories, platform updates. Keep Molt Mart top-of-mind.

7. **Re-engagement for dormant affiliates** — After 30 days of no clicks: "Your referral link has been inactive. Here's what you're missing..." with earnings projection.

8. **Exclusive perks at higher tiers:**
   - Silver: Early access to new templates (24h before public)
   - Gold: Custom referral URL (`moltmart.com/ref/yourname`), featured in affiliate directory
   - Platinum: Direct line to team, co-marketing opportunities, exclusive templates to give away

## 11. What NOT to Do

### Common Affiliate Program Mistakes

1. **❌ Making signup complicated** — Every form field you add loses 10% of signups. One click to join. No tax forms upfront. No approval process.

2. **❌ Hiding the affiliate program** — If it's buried in the footer, no one finds it. Put it in the main nav, in the dashboard sidebar, in post-purchase flows.

3. **❌ Delayed tracking feedback** — If an affiliate shares a link and sees 0 clicks for 24 hours (due to delayed processing), they assume it's broken and quit. Real-time click tracking is non-negotiable.

4. **❌ Only paying on first purchase** — This is the #1 reason affiliates abandon programs. If a referred user buys 10 templates over 6 months but the affiliate only earns on the first one, they feel cheated. Lifetime attribution is the answer.

5. **❌ Complicated terms & conditions** — Don't write a 5,000-word legal document. Simple rules: promote honestly, don't spam, don't self-refer. Done.

6. **❌ No communication after signup** — "Set it and forget it" applies to the *affiliate's effort*, not the *program's effort*. Send weekly/monthly emails. Show them you care about their success.

7. **❌ Ignoring small affiliates** — 80% of your affiliate revenue will come from the long tail of small affiliates, not the top 5. Make the program work for someone with 100 Twitter followers, not just influencers.

8. **❌ Resetting tiers monthly** — Tiers should be permanent (based on lifetime referrals). Monthly resets punish loyalty and make people feel like they're on a treadmill.

9. **❌ No shareable content** — Expecting affiliates to write their own promotional copy is like expecting customers to write their own ads. Provide it.

10. **❌ Paying too late or unreliably** — Even with stubbed payments, be transparent: "Payments launch in Q2. All earnings are tracked and will be paid retroactively." Under-promise, over-deliver.

11. **❌ Self-referral loopholes** — Don't let people refer themselves. It poisons the data and attracts the wrong affiliates. Hash IPs, check for matching emails, and make the rule clear.

12. **❌ Forgetting mobile** — The dashboard and sharing flow must work perfectly on mobile. Many affiliates will share from their phone.
