# DexScreener Search Popup — Visual Reference

Thomas provided a screenshot of DexScreener's search popup for UI inspiration.

## Layout (from screenshot):
- **Dark overlay/popup** takes over most of the screen
- **Search bar** at the very top (full width, with search icon)
- **Ad banner** below search (we won't do this)
- **History section** — "Nothing to see here..." (recent searches)
- **Filter tabs** — "Boosted", "Latest", "Top" + horizontally scrolling promoted tokens with boost counts
- **"Recently Updated Token Info"** heading with **"Claim your spot here >"** CTA on the right
- **3-column grid** of promoted items, each card has:
  - Small square thumbnail/logo (left)
  - Name (bold, right of thumbnail)
  - Chain/category label below name (e.g. "Solana")
  - Social icons (X, website, TikTok)
  - Cards are compact — roughly 1/3 width each
  - Rows continue for many items (scrollable)
- Background is dark (#1a1a2e style)
- Cards have subtle borders/backgrounds

## Key Takeaways for Molt Mart:
- Keep cards COMPACT — thumbnail + name + category + quick stats only
- 3-column grid is clean and dense
- "Claim your spot here" CTA equivalent = encourages sellers to promote
- Search bar stays at top, promoted content fills the rest
- Clean, dark-themed popup feel
- No heavy cards — these are MINI previews, not full template cards
- Social proof via small icons/badges, not full descriptions
