Hey Thomas, here's a quick breakdown of the items you flagged as confusing or not seeing:

**#6 — "Sell link goes to login"**
When someone visits your site without being logged in and clicks "Sell" in the navbar, it just dumps them on the login page. The auditors thought there should be a landing page explaining how selling works. You probably don't see it because you're always logged in. Not a big deal though — most sellers will sign up first anyway. ✅ Skipping this.

**#13 — "No redirect back after login"**
Say someone is looking at a template and clicks Download, which asks them to log in. After they log in, they end up on the dashboard instead of back at that template. It's about keeping the user's flow intact. ✅ Skipping for now.

**#15 — "Mobile sign-out"**
The auditors just wanted to double-check the sign-out button on mobile actually works. Since you've been using it without problems, we're good. ✅ No action needed.

**#17 — "No active nav states"**
This means when you're on the Browse page, the "Browse" link in the navbar should look highlighted/bold so users know what page they're on. It's a small visual polish thing. ✅ Skipping for now.

**#22 — "Add breadcrumbs"**
Breadcrumbs = that little trail at the top of a page like **Home > Browse > Template Name** that helps people navigate back. Common on shopping sites. Nice to have but not essential right now. ✅ Skipping for now.
